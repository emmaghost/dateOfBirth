# dateOfBirth
this program generate which are the dates with more living persons in the years that we have in an array


if you need only the date without the array, you can comment the console.log in the function getDataConc() before the return.
Why I return the array in console? 
Becouse i have many dates with the same number of years live so, i dont now what date i should return
